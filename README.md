# Linear constrained optimization for HBP* design

*[This branch represents the version of the code used for the 2023 Value in Health submission - "Revision of Malawiâ€™s Health Benefits Package for primary and secondary care: a critical analysis of policy formulation". See master branch for the latest version.]*


This repository contains the script which uses intervention-level data on cost-effectiveness, size of eligible population,  consuambles cost
to generate an optimal health benefits package for a country, which maximises the population health impact given the chosen constraints. 


The model is replicated from the analysis performed for a previous study - Mohan S, Walker S, Sengooba F, et al. Supporting the revision of the health benefits package in Uganda: a constrained optimisation approach. Health Economics. 32(6): 1244-1255. https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4664
